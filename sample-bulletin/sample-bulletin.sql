The entrance is located on the northern side of a rocky outcrop at the head of a tributary of Clay Run.\r\n\r\nThe triangle-shaped entrance of Power Line Cave is 2 feet high and 3 feet wide. The entrance passage slopes down 8 feet, leading through a small shower of water coming from the ceiling. It opens into a 4-foot-wide, 7-foot-high passage that goes northeast for 40 feet and dead-ends. There are old names and dates carved on the wall here, most of which appear to be local. A hands-and-knees crawlway in the right wall leads to a stream crawlway that parallels the entrance passage. To the left (northeast), this parallel passage pinches out, but to the right, it goes 50 feet to a small room where water rains down from cracks in the ceiling. From there, a low passage to the east leads to a \"T\" junction with the main trunk passage. \r\n\r\nLeft at the \"T\" junction: The passage in this direction (northeast) is 10 feet high and 15 to 20 feet wide. Forty feet from the \"T\", a stream enters from the right. The walking passage continues downstream for a few hundred feet, terminating at a rock wall, with a very low passage at the base, into which the stream flows. The passage appears to continue, but there is only a few inches of airspace, so pushing it would require very dry weather. \r\n\r\nThere is another side passage here that goes uphill until it becomes too tight to follow. Unlike the rest of the cave, which moves air, there is no air movement in this passage.\r\n\r\nRight at the \"T\" junction: The cave in this direction (southwest) starts out as walking passage, but becomes a hands-and-knees crawl and then a bellycrawl. After 20 feet or so, there is a junction with the upstream section of the cave stream. Going upstream, the cave continues for 40 feet as a low, wet bellycrawl. The passage constricts and continues, very low and wet.\r\n\r\nThere is fresh surface debris in the ceiling throughout this cave, including in the trunk passage, indicating that the cave periodically floods to the ceiling.','','','','','Note: This is just a sample feature to show the cavedbmanager web application.

Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 (1 July-30 June) reported landing 112,934 metric tons. Unregulated fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish, is a serious problem. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources determines the recommended catch limits for marine species. A total of 13,571 tourists visited in the 2002-03 antarctic summer, up from the 11,588 who visited the previous year. Nearly all of them were passengers on commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several yachts that make trips during the summer. Most tourist trips last approximately two weeks. \r\n\r\nthere are no developed ports and harbors in Antarctica; most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges, and helicopters; a few stations have a basic wharf facility; US coastal stations include McMurdo (77 51 S, 166 40 E), Palmer (64 43 S, 64 03 W); government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under \"Legal System\"); all ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, Antarctic Treaty; offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent ','','','','','Note: This is public domain text from the CIA World Factbook about Antarctica to fill up content in the sample document.',NULL,'','','','',NULL,'','2016-02-07 20:00:00','2016-02-07 20:00:00');
