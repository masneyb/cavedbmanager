# cavedbmanager

This project simplifies the data management for a state and/or county cave
survey. It eliminates the need for the manual duplication of data, which will
help to save time and minimize errors. The system dynamically generates
various types of files based on the data that you upload to the database:

* GIS files: SHP, KML (Google Earth), GPX, MXF (Maptech), and images generated
  using Mapserver with your cave locations and cave lineplots overlayed onto
  them.
* A PDF that is suitable for publication.
* ZIP file whose contents include select photos, maps, and references. All of
  the filenames are standardized to a common naming convention. The contents of
  this ZIP file can be written to a CD or DVD and included with the book.
* To-do list
* CSV file (Spreadsheet)

This significantly reduces the hassle of formatting the book and allows the user
to concentrate on the collection of data.

This project is currently used by the West Virginia Speleological Survey
to manage over 5,000 cave and karst features within the state. The web interface
is only available to its members.


## Sample Bulletin

A [sample bulletin](sample-bulletin/sample-bulletin.pdf?raw=1) is available that
shows a PDF that was generated by this application based on the data that as
added through the web interface. Full instructions about how to recreate this
sample document are below.

Screenshots of the web application and other generated artifacts are available
in the [screenshots](screenshots) directory.


## Some notes about the generated Sample Bulletin PDF

* The title page, preamble page and contributor pages (i, ii, and iii) can
  all be edited in the bulletin section of the web interface. The content
  is styled using LaTeX.
* The Table of Contents on page iv shows the list of bulletin regions
  associated with the bulletin.
* The map on page v shows the position of all of the regions as they relate
  to each other. The rectangles labeled Coopers Rock and Test Region were
  dynamically drawn based on the extent of all features that are present
  inside each region. If you add a new feature outside of the rectangle,
  then the rectangle will be dynamically expanded the next time that
  the bulletin is regenerated.
* The maps on pages 1, 2, 7 and 8 were all dynamically generated based on
  the features associated with each region.
* Additional terms can be added to the index on page 13. Edit the bulletin
  and add your terms to the Indexed Terms section. Separate each term with
  a newline.


## Installation

* These directions have only been tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04
  running Django 1.8.7.
* Install the [postgis-data-importer](https://github.com/masneyb/postgis-data-importer)
  project to support setting up your GIS layers in a PostgreSQL database.
  * If you are planning to generate the sample bulletin, then you only need to include the
    DEMs and aerial imagery for the Aurora, Lake Lynn and Lead Mine 7.5 minute quads. By
    default, the import script will download the data for these quads, along with all of
    the other 7.5 minute quads in West Virginia that are underlain by karst.
* Install package dependencies:
  * `sudo apt-get install -y python-psycopg2 python-django python-imaging python-dateutil
     python-gdal python-pylint-django texlive texlive-latex-extra python2.7 zip mapserver-bin
     ttf-freefont make`
* Update your database settings in _cavedb/settings.py_. Be sure to change
  the SECRET_KEY setting to random data if you are running the server
  on a non-loopback interface.
* Install the sample data: `./sample-bulletin/populate-sample-bulletin.sh`. Be sure
  to read the comments in the file and make any appropriate changes before running.
* Start the server: `make run`. The server will only listen to the
  loopback interface. Use `make runRemote` to have it bind to
  all network interfaces. The latter is useful if you are testing
  from inside a virtual machine.
* Log into the web interface.
  * Click on the Bulletins link on the main page. In the documents column,
    click on the generate link. After a few minutes, refresh the page and
    you should see generated documents if everything went well.
  * Build output is stored in
    /usr/local/cavedbmanager-data/bulletins/bulletin_1/bulletin-build-output.txt.
    if you need to troubleshoot any issues.


## Publications

This system was used to publish the book:

* West Virginia Speleological Survey Bulletin #18: The Caves and Karst of
  Tucker County by Doug McCarty and Brian Masney, 2011. Includes 304 cave and
  karst features, 155 photos, and 96 maps; contains CD-ROM with full-sized
  color versions of all maps and photos, plus extras.

This book is available for sale to [NSS members](http://caves.org/) through
the [West Virginia Speleological Survey](http://www.wvass.org/publications.html).
It is also available for purchase through the
[NSS Bookstore](https://bookstore.caves.org/index.php?mode=store&submode=showitem&itemnumber=01-0687)
